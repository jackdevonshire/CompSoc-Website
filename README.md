# CompSoc-Website
A basic flask website for the CompSoc Website, with an API for updating links and events. The API can be interfaced with through the use of a Google Spreadsheet, with some Google Apps Script code I have also written.

The frontend code for this project (in the flask source /templates and /static directories) is an adapted version of a codepen (https://codepen.io/gzkdev/pen/RwjxzzK), the license for which can be found in this repository.
